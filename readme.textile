h1. Tabby

p. Tabby is a Google Chrome extension which removes old tabs for you automatically (currently timing out at ten minues). Based on "Greg Leppert's":http://formasfunction.com "tweet":http://twitter.com/#!/formasfunction/status/67288399609995265, "The chore of maintaining and pruning browser tabs & windows is flawed. I want neglected ones to slowly fade away, to sink back into the dirt".
